                    <p class="featured_film__paragraph">
                        Wake in Fright is a classic from the early days of the 1970s Australian film renaissance. First released in 1971, the film was restored by the NFSA and re-released in 2009.
                        It had been thought lost for decades until the film's editor, Anthony Buckley, located the original negatives in Pittsburgh, USA where they were marked 'for destruction'.
                        </p>
                    <p class="featured_film__paragraph">
                        Wake in Fright starred British actors Gary Bond, Donald Pleasence and Sylvia Kay but was notable for being both the first film for Jack Thompson and the last for Chips Rafferty.
                        It is also one of only two films to ever be selected for the Cannes Film Festival twice – in 1971, for the Official Competition, and then in 2009 when the restoration screened as part of Cannes Classics.
                    </p>
                    <p class="featured_film__paragraph">
                        Based on the novel by Kenneth Cook and directed by Canadian-born Ted Kotcheff, it is about a young schoolteacher who finds himself stranded in an outback mining town. Over the course of a few days, he loses his money, inhibitions, self-respect – and almost his life.
                        This collection features materials relating to the film's original release in 1971 and its restoration nearly 40 years later, including memories from director Ted Kotcheff and others who worked on it; clips from the film; trailers; international film posters and the story behind an unusual prop.

It features a montage of images that sum up the key moments from the film: the romance between Jim (Tom Burlinson) and Jessica (Sigrid Thornton), Jack Thompson with a stockwhip, Kirk Douglas with a beard and bush hat in one of the two roles he plays, and a group of men on horses riding towards the camera.">

                    <p class="featured_film__paragraph">
                        'There was movement at the station, for the word had passed around | That the colt from old Regret had got away...'

                    <p class="featured_film__paragraph">
                        Based on Banjo Paterson's poem of the same name, The Man from Snowy River was a huge hit with audiences in Australia and very well-received overseas.
                    </p>
                    <p class="featured_film__paragraph">
                        The film combined an Australian western with a stirring melodrama and period romance, set against a rugged mountain backdrop of wild horses and beautiful landscapes.

                    <p class="featured_film__paragraph">
                        This collection includes clips, images and posters from the film; an extensive interview with the cast on The Mike Walsh Show in 1982; on-set reports of the making of the film; and an audio interview clip with producer Geoff Burrowes and director George Miller.

                    <p class="featured_film__paragraph">
                        Crocodile Dundee remains the most commercially successful Australian film ever made, with Paul Hogan’s iconic Mick Dundee at the heart of the film. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="featured_film__paragraph">
                        It opened in Australian cinemas on 24 April 1986 and has gone on to be one of the most successful non-Hollywood films of all time.
                    </p>
                    <p class="featured_film__paragraph">
                        Crocodile Dundee II, made three years after the first film, gives loveable larrikin Mick Dundee more chances to get himself into (and out of) trouble. This time drug barons are after his journalist girlfriend Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski).
